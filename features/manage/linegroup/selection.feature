  Scenario: Select multiple reservations
     When I open a take back, hand over or I edit a contract
      And I select all reservations of an linegroup
     Then the linegroup is selected
      And the count matches the amount of selected reservations
     When I open a take back
      And I select the linegroup
     Then all reservations of that linegroup are selected
      And the count matches the amount of selected reservations
